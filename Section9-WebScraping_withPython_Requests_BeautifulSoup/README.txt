Change to this Directory
$ cd ~/Documents/Python Lessons (GitHub)/30-days-of-python-Udemy/Section9-WebScraping_withPyth
on_Requests_BeautifulSoup

and then start a new python virtual environment on folder "scrape" and cd to that folder, from the terminal:
$ virtualenv -p python3 scrape && cd scrape

and proceed to activate the directory virtual environment
$ source bin/activate

And then just follow along with the following commands:
$pip freeze
$pip install requests beautifulsoup4
$pip freeze -> you can now see the required packages and its dependencies installed.
$python

We played around a bit with requests and beautifulsoup4 modules. Look at the file scrape.py for the full code :)
